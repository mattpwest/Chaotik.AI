# Chaotik AI

My own AI utility library for C#.

Largely being built as a learning exercise to ensure I understand all the
algorithms I'm using. The design philosophy is to keep it as near to vanilla
C# as possible rather than closely integrated with Unity: this will allow using
this as a server side implementation or for a more purist DDD approach, without
tying the game logic to Unity.

# Features

The following features have been implemented thus far:

 * SparseGraph data structure
 * Graph loading (roguelike grid or adjacency list CSV)
 * Graph search algorithms:
   * Depth First Search
